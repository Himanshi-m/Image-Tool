# Image Manipulation Tool

This Python-based Image tool, built using **Streamlit**, allows users to perform various image manipulation tasks such as resizing, cropping, format conversion, and enhancement. With an intuitive, web-based interface, users can make adjustments with real-time previews. This tool is designed for single-image processing, providing a simple yet powerful platform for common image editing tasks.

**Approach:**
- The project started with research into image manipulation using Python libraries like `Pillow` and `Streamlit`. 
- Tools like `streamlit-cropper` were integrated for easier cropping.
  
**Additional Resources:**
- Streamlit documentation https://streamlit.io/
- Pillow library documentation https://readthedocs.org/projects/pillow/

## EXPLANATION

### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES
1. **Image Resizing**: Users can resize images by height, width, or percentage.
2. **Image Cropping**: Provides an interactive cropping tool using `streamlit-cropper` with aspect ratio control.
3. **Format Conversion**: Converts images to popular formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.
4. **Enhancement**: Adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color.

### WHAT I HAVE DONE
1. Researched tools like `Streamlit` and `Pillow` for image manipulation.
2. Developed a basic interface using `Streamlit` for uploading and previewing images.
3. Integrated resizing functionality with live previews.
4. Added image cropping using `streamlit-cropper`.
5. Implemented format conversion with compression quality controls.
6. Enabled image enhancement options (brightness, contrast, sharpness, color).
7. Ensured images can be saved and downloaded after edits.

### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS
1. **Trade-off 1**: Keeping the interface simple vs. adding advanced features.  
   - **Solution**: Prioritized simplicity, only adding essential features like resizing, cropping, and enhancement.
2. **Trade-off 2**: Balancing performance with real-time previews.  
   - **Solution**: Implemented lightweight image previews using `Pillow` and optimized backend logic.

### LIBRARIES NEEDED
- `streamlit`
- `Pillow`
- `streamlit-cropper`
